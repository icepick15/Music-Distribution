# Payment System Improvements âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Polling Timeout Issue ðŸ”„
**Problem:** Users who stayed on the Paystack payment page longer than 60 seconds would not have their payment detected automatically.

**Solution:**
- Extended polling duration from **1 minute to 5 minutes** (60 polls instead of 12)
- Poll interval: Every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes
- Added helpful toast message when max attempts reached
- This handles cases where users:
  - Take time to enter card details
  - Need to verify with bank OTP
  - Experience network delays
  - Switch between payment methods on Paystack

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/SubscriptionPage.jsx`

### 2. Email Templates with Real Data ðŸ“§
**Problem:** Payment success/failure emails were showing placeholder/generic data instead of actual transaction details.

**Solution:**
Updated notification signals to send comprehensive real-time data:

#### Payment Success Email Data:
- âœ… Real amount (formatted with commas: â‚¦5,000.00)
- âœ… Subscription type (Yearly Premium / Pay Per Song)
- âœ… Upload credits remaining
- âœ… Subscription validity period
- âœ… Transaction reference number
- âœ… Payment date and time
- âœ… Plan benefits (Unlimited uploads / Credit count)
- âœ… Royalty share percentage (90% or 95%)
- âœ… Processing time (Standard 3-5 days / Priority 1-2 days)

#### Payment Failed Email Data:
- âœ… Real amount attempted
- âœ… Failure reason (from Paystack)
- âœ… Transaction reference
- âœ… Attempt date
- âœ… Retry suggestions
- âœ… Common causes of failure
- âœ… Direct links to retry payment

**Files Modified:**
- `src/apps/notifications/signals.py`
- `templates/notifications/payment_received.html`
- `templates/notifications/payment_failed.html`

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes (signals.py)

#### Success Notification:
```python
# Now includes:
- subscription_type: 'yearly' | 'pay_per_song' | 'free'
- credits_remaining: int
- credits_info: "X upload credits"
- subscription_end_date: "January 15, 2026"
- subscription_valid_until: "January 15, 2026" | "No expiry"
- payment_date: "October 3, 2025"
- payment_time: "02:30 PM"
- reference: "txn_abc123xyz"
- formatted amount: "5,000.00" (with commas)
```

#### Failed Notification:
```python
# Now includes:
- failure_reason: From payment metadata or default message
- attempt_date: "October 3, 2025"
- retry_date: 7 days from attempt
- reference: Transaction reference
- description: What they were trying to purchase
```

### Frontend Changes (SubscriptionPage.jsx)

#### Polling Configuration:
```javascript
// Before:
const maxPolls = 12; // 1 minute total

// After:
const maxPolls = 60; // 5 minutes total

// Additional:
- Added helpful toast when timeout occurs
- Manual verification button still available as backup
```

## Email Template Improvements

### Payment Success Email
**Before:**
- Generic placeholder amounts ($125.67)
- Fake royalty breakdowns
- Next payment dates (not applicable to subscriptions)

**After:**
- Real subscription amount in Naira (â‚¦5,000.00 or â‚¦39,900.00)
- Actual subscription details:
  - For Yearly: "Unlimited uploads until [date]"
  - For Pay Per Song: "X upload credits (never expire)"
- Plan-specific benefits
- Real transaction reference

### Payment Failed Email
**Before:**
- Generic bank account error messages
- Irrelevant payment period information
- Automatic retry dates (we don't auto-retry)

**After:**
- Actual Paystack failure reason
- Real transaction reference
- Common causes specific to card payments
- Direct "Try Again" button to subscription page
- Contact support option

## Testing Checklist

### Test Scenarios:
1. âœ… **Fast Payment** (< 30 seconds)
   - User completes payment quickly
   - Should detect within 5-10 seconds
   
2. âœ… **Slow Payment** (1-3 minutes)
   - User takes time entering card details
   - Should detect within 5 minutes
   - Polling continues throughout

3. âœ… **Very Slow Payment** (> 5 minutes)
   - User abandons and comes back later
   - Manual verification button appears
   - User can manually verify payment

4. âœ… **Email Content - Success**
   - Check subscription type is correct
   - Verify credits/expiry date shown
   - Confirm amount matches payment
   
5. âœ… **Email Content - Failure**

   - Verify transaction reference shown
   - Confirm "Try Again" button works

## Benefits

### User Experience:
- âœ… No more stuck "Processing..." buttons
- âœ… Works even if user is slow on payment page
- âœ… Emails contain actual useful information
- âœ… Clear next steps in failure emails

### Technical:

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Payment Webhook** (Recommended)
   - Set up Paystack webhook endpoint
   - Get instant notification when payment succeeds
   - Eliminate need for polling entirely
   - More reliable than frontend polling

2. **Email Customization**
   - Add user's subscription start/end dates
   - Include list of platforms they can distribute to
   - Add quick links to upload first song

3. **SMS Notifications** (Optional)
   - Send SMS for payment success
   - Particularly useful in Nigeria
   - Can use Termii or Africa's Talking

## Notes

- Currency is Naira (â‚¦) throughout
- All dates formatted as "Month DD, YYYY"
- Amounts formatted with commas (e.g., 39,900.00)
- Email templates are mobile-responsive
- Polling runs in background (doesn't block UI)

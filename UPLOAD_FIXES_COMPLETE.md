  disabled={subscription?.subscription_type === 'pay_per_song'}
>
  <option value="single">Single</option>
  {subscription?.subscription_type === 'yearly' && (
    <>
      <option value="ep">EP</option>
      <option value="album">Album</option>
      <option value="compilation">Compilation</option>
    </>
